This command uploads a public key file to the account's key database. Example:{br}
{command} account john@doe.com -upload-pubkey mykey.gpg.pub{br}
The file extension does not matter. You can also supply the key on stdin by using filename '-'. Example:{br}
cat mykey.gpg.pub | {command} account john@doe.com -upload-pubkey -{br}
